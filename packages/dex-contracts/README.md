```bash
python3 scripts/generate-path-contracts.py

- `dist/release-catalog-v2.schema.json`: release-catalog v2 schema with an honest immutable-tag pattern
- `dist/index.js`: runtime helper exports
- `dist/index.d.ts`: TypeScript declarations
- `dist/connections.contract.json`: frozen connection-manager CLI, status, storage, locking, ownership, and versioning ABI
- `dist/connections.schema.json`: JSON Schema definitions for accessor/status/encrypted-envelope outputs
- `dist/connections-engine.manifest.json`: checksummed vendoring manifest for the consumable engine
- `fixtures/connections/`: canonical consumer examples for all frozen outputs and five statuses
