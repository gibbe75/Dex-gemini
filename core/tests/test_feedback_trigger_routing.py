"""Routing contract for casual bug reports in the shipped Dex persona.

Dave's requirement (2026-08-11): users "just need to be in normal wording and
normal language and Dex will figure it out that this is a bug." Onboarding now
tells users exactly that, so `CLAUDE.md` has to carry a trigger block that makes
it real — in the same pattern as the Granola and task-app blocks.

What these tests can and cannot prove: routing is ultimately model judgement, and
this repository has no LLM eval harness, so nothing here executes a model. These
are instruction-contract tests, the same kind as `test_instruction_honesty.py`
and `test_health_telemetry_consent_ux.py`: they pin the phrasings the block must
recognise, the cases it must NOT claim (false positives cost more than misses
here — a wrongly filed report burns the user's trust and the team's triage), and
the fact that the block does not collide with the ideas backlog next to it.
