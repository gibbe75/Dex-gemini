"""Guard the diff-gate scripts against re-shallowing the base ref.

The PR diff gates (path-contract, doc-drift, test-delta, coverage) compute
`git merge-base HEAD origin/<base>`. Fetching the base ref with `--depth=1`
grafts it with no parents, so merge-base can't find the common ancestor and the
gate fails with a spurious "no common ancestor" error — which is exactly what
happened in CI (a `--depth=1`-in-CI fetch from an earlier fix). These tests pin
the base-ref fetch to a plain fetch so that regression can't return.
