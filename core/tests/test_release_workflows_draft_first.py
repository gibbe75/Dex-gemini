"""Workflow-shape contract: nothing in CI may publish a release before its assets.

scripts/release_publish.py enforces the ordering at runtime. These tests enforce
that the workflows actually GO THROUGH it -- because the v1.94.0 incident was not a
bug inside a script, it was two workflows each doing something reasonable on its own.
A future edit that reintroduces a bare `gh release create` without `--draft`, or a
bare `gh release upload`, fails here.
