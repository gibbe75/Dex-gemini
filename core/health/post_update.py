"""One real walk through the user's door immediately after an update.

The v1.84.0 activation incident lived exclusively in the moment after a
delivered release applied: from that instant every gated lifecycle operation
(plan, state, adoption, rewind) refused, while updates themselves kept
working — and nothing exercised a gated operation until a human did, so the
breakage surfaced days later as a mystery.  This canary is that exercise,
run at the only moment that matters.  It calls the same public operations
the product uses, read-only, and writes a receipt either way so health
surfaces can see that the check happened.
