"""Keep CLAUDE.md in step with CLAUDE-custom.md between updates.

`CLAUDE.md` is composed from the release template plus the user's
`CLAUDE-custom.md`. Until now that composition ran only inside the
delivered-release transaction, so an instruction written into the custom block
did nothing until the next update applied. On a vault already at the newest
release that is indefinite, and it is silent: the file saves, the content is
correct, and the instruction simply never loads.

The trust problem is worse than the latency one. Dex confirms the customisation
has been made and the user reasonably believes it is in force. Recomposing
between updates makes that confirmation true.

Nothing here is new state. The output is exactly what the next update would
produce from the same two inputs, so this is the same result arriving earlier.
The write still takes the shared vault mutation lock — or refuses when an
update already holds it — so a hook cannot compose from a stale activation
tag and overwrite a mid-apply CLAUDE.md.

Two-stage by design. The cheap gate is a pair of `stat` calls and is what runs
on almost every invocation; the expensive path only runs when the custom file
has actually moved. See `needs_recompose`.
