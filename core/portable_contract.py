"""The portable-vault ownership contract: who owns every path in a Dex install.

This module is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for the ownership contract ratified in
Vault_Contract v1 (2026-06-18) — the shared spine consumed by the Brain/Vault
split (migrator), the upgrade engine (snapshot/apply/verify/rollback), and the
capability rooms. The committed JSON view in
``packages/dex-contracts/dist/portable-vault.contract.json`` is generated from
here by ``scripts/generate-portable-contract.py`` and must never be hand-edited.

Five ownership classes:

- ``brain``      release-owned; an update replaces it wholesale.
- ``vault``      the user's content; an update NEVER writes it.
- ``seed``       shipped once, then user-owned; written only if absent.
- ``generated``  machine-derived; regenerated, neither user- nor release-precious.
- ``runtime``    local machine state; never shipped, never updated.

Resolution semantics (``resolve``): the hard-deny patterns are checked first
and veto everything; then the most specific rule wins (exact file match beats
directory prefix; longer prefix beats shorter). Every tracked repo path MUST
resolve — ``scripts/check-portable-contract.sh`` fails CI otherwise — so adding
a new top-level path to the repo requires a deliberate classification here.

LIMITATION — folder remapping (Vault_Contract §2a): classification assumes the
DEFAULT PARA layout. A user may remap folders via ``System/folder-paths.yaml``;
consumers scanning a real installed vault MUST canonicalize remapped paths back
to their semantic defaults before resolving, or treat them as unclassified.
The fail-safe is :func:`update_write_verdict`: an unclassified path is NEVER
written. Native ``folder_map`` support lands with the first consumer (PR-1).

Design notes live in ``docs/portable-vault-contract-design.md``.
