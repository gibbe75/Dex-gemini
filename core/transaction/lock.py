"""Owner-safe mutation lock — one mutating engine per vault at a time.

A faithful Python port of the semantics proven in the v1→v2 migrator's
``owned-lock.cjs`` (PR #141):

- create-exclusive lock file (0o600) carrying ``{pid, kind, token, at}``,
  fsynced, parent directory fsynced — so a crash cannot leave a torn lock.
  A failure between creating the lock file and returning its ``release()``
  removes the file before re-raising: leaving it behind would orphan a lock
  naming our own live PID, which every later acquisition — including our
  own — must refuse as busy (issue #257 hit exactly this on Windows, where
  the directory fsync used to raise after the lock file existed);
- liveness by signal-0 probe of the recorded PID (EPERM counts as alive);
  on Windows a query-only process handle is used instead, because os.kill
  is documented to unconditionally TerminateProcess the target there
  (Node's ``process.kill(pid, 0)`` in the CJS twin is a genuine probe, so
  the twin keeps it);
- stale-lock takeover only via *pinned removal*: the lock is removed only if
  its device+inode+exact bytes still match what was observed, so two waiters
  can never both "clean up" and race into ownership;
- release only removes the lock if it still carries our token on our inode —
  releasing after a takeover is a no-op, never a theft.

The lock file is shared with the CJS migrator by PATH (both engines lock the
same file), which is what guarantees "one mutator per vault" across languages.
