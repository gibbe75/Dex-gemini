# Release catalog item declarations

This is the publisher-owned source of truth for lifecycle catalog items. The
release builder reads every JSON file here in filename order, except the
separately modeled `bridge-release.json`, and emits the canonical
`System/.release-catalog.json` through the B1 model and schema.

`bridge-release.json` keeps the publisher-owned bridge contract and transaction
journal compatibility window. During a release build, the same generator that
emits `System/.release-catalog.json` stamps only its `release_version` from
`package.json`, validates the complete declaration through the strict bridge
model, and ships both files with the same version. The checked-in declaration
matches the repository package version for local development; it is not a
placeholder and the release build does not weaken the runtime equality check.

Each source file is a closed document:

```json
{
  "catalog_source_version": 1,
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "decision-log",
      "kind": "skill",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "files": [
        {
          "path": ".claude/skills/decision-log/SKILL.md",
          "source_path": ".claude/skills/decision-log/SKILL.md",
          "sha256": "<exact lowercase sha256>",
          "byte_size": 1234
        }
      ],
      "dependencies": [],
      "capabilities": []
    }
  ]
}
```

`path` is the active transaction target. Optional `source_path` is the
release-shipped payload whose exact bytes adoption writes there; when omitted,
it defaults to `path`. The paths are identical for files that ship active,
while optional capabilities can remain dormant until an approved adoption. The
publisher declaration pins each payload's exact hash and byte size. The
generator rejects stale pins, derives target ownership classes and rewind
tokens from the exact release tree, and validates the emitted items through the
v1 model and schema. The first official item declarations live in
`official-capabilities.json`.
