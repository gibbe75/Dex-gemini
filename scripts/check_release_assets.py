"""Prove the newest Dex release is actually downloadable, from the outside.

Draft-first publishing (scripts/release_publish.py) makes a public-but-empty
release unreachable through the normal path. This is the independent watchman for
everything that path cannot cover: a release cut by an older pipeline, an asset
deleted or replaced by hand, a rescue document pointing at a version that was
never published, or a release left half-attached by a partial upload.

It checks two URL sets, both over plain unauthenticated HTTPS -- the same route a
user's `curl` takes, not an authenticated API view that can succeed while the
public route fails:

  1. The four asset URLs of the current "Latest" release.
  2. Every release-download URL written literally into docs/UPDATE-RESCUE.md.

The second set is the one that actually broke on 2026-08-11: the rescue guide is
rewritten to name the new version at the moment a release is cut, so it pointed
at a bridge that did not exist yet and a stuck user following it got "not found".

Exit codes are deliberately distinct, because "the release is broken" and "I could
not tell" must never be reported the same way:

  0  every probed URL served bytes and every checksum matched
  1  a real failure -- something a user would hit
  2  the check could not run (no network, GitHub unreachable, no release found)

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check_release_assets.py
    python3 scripts/check_release_assets.py --json report.json
    python3 scripts/check_release_assets.py --version 1.94.0   # probe one version
