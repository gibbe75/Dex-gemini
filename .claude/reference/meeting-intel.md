# Meeting Intelligence Reference

Process meetings from Granola to extract structured insights, action items, and update person pages.

## How It Works

Meetings sync **automatically in the background** every 30 minutes via the official Granola public API.

```
Granola App (desktop + mobile) → Granola Cloud → Official Granola API → Background Sync (every 30 min) → Meeting notes with attendees → Entity creation + verification → /process-meetings → Context updates, Tasks
```

**Key features:** Mobile phone recordings are captured alongside desktop meetings — the official API returns both. Connect once with `/granola-setup` to add your Granola API key; there's no separate per-device setup.

## Setup (One-Time)

### 1. Install automation (30 seconds)

```bash
cd .scripts/meeting-intel && ./install-automation.sh
```

This will:
- Check prerequisites (Node.js, Granola API key, LLM API key)
- Install the 30-minute background sync via macOS Launch Agent

### 2. Connect Granola

Dex talks to the official Granola public API using your own API key. Run `/granola-setup` to add it — Dex stores it as `GRANOLA_API_KEY` for you. Once connected, sync works automatically with no per-device or sign-in step.

**Requirements:**
- A Granola Business plan (the official API key, format `grn_...`, is created there)
- Your Granola API key connected via `/granola-setup`
- An LLM API key in `.env` (GEMINI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, or OPENAI_API_KEY)

## Data Sources

| Source | What it captures | When used |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Official Granola API** (only source) | Desktop + mobile recordings, notes, transcripts | When your Granola API key is connected via `/granola-setup` |

There is no local-file fallback — the official Granola API is the single source of truth.

## Using /process-meetings

After setup, `/process-meetings` reads synced files and updates your vault:

```
/process-meetings           # Process all synced meetings (last 7 days)
/process-meetings today     # Just today's meetings
/process-meetings "Acme"    # Find meetings by title/attendee
/process-meetings --setup   # Install/check background automation
```

**Flags:**
- `--people-only` — Only update person/company pages (skip tasks)
- `--no-todos` — Create notes but don't extract tasks
- `--days-back=N` — Override default 7-day lookback

**What gets updated:**
- Meeting notes (00-Inbox/Meetings/) — attendee names, emails when available, and Internal/External location in frontmatter
- Person and company pages (05-Areas/) — deterministically created in `auto` mode or queued in `suggest` mode after qualifying evidence
- Existing person and company pages — meeting references, last interaction dates, key contacts, and meeting history
- Entity verification (System/.dex/) — coverage checked after every sync; `/dex-doctor` reports the same engine health
- Tasks (03-Tasks/Tasks.md) — action items extracted from meetings

People qualify after 2+ meetings across 2+ weeks, or after 2+ meetings where at least one has a transcript. An attendee without an email is tracked but never auto-created. In Obsidian mode, auto-linking points names at the person pages' actual vault paths.

## Session-Start Detection

`00-Inbox/Meetings/` is the meeting landing zone. Anything that drops a meeting
note there — Granola sync, a pasted note, a hand-dropped file, or a future
service integration — is detected at session start and processed by
`/process-meetings`. New fetchers should write to this folder rather than add
their own detection path.

A meeting-shaped note is waiting when its date is within seven days, it has no
`<!-- tasks-extracted: -->` marker, it has no `<!-- dex:skip-processing -->`
opt-out, and it either has `ai_analyzed: false` or an unchecked item under
`### For Me`. This applies to Granola-synced notes in day directories and flat,
manually captured `YYYY-MM-DD - Topic.md` notes in the landing-zone root, with
or without frontmatter. A user can add `<!-- dex:skip-processing -->` to any
meeting note to permanently exclude it from processing and from the sweep.

Manual-mode JSON files in `00-Inbox/Meetings/queue/` also count as waiting.
`/process-meetings` consumes each queue file by writing its meeting note into
the landing zone before deleting the JSON, then processes the note normally.
No Granola credentials are required for landing-zone detection, queued meetings,
or manually captured notes.

A notice is limited to once every 30 minutes through
`System/.last-meeting-queue-notice`, and the check stays silent when nothing is
waiting.

The detector never processes or edits a meeting. `/process-meetings` still owns that work and continues to respect the vault's `entity_creation` setting.

## What Gets Extracted

The background sync uses your LLM API to extract:

- **Summary** (2-3 sentences)
- **Key discussion points** with context
- **Decisions made**
- **Action items** (for you and others, with task IDs for sync)
- **Customer intelligence** (pain points, feature requests, competitive mentions)
- **Pillar classification** based on your `System/pillars.yaml`

**Output location:** `00-Inbox/Meetings/YYYY-MM-DD/meeting-slug.md`

## Configuration

Meeting intelligence is configured in `System/user-profile.yaml`:

```yaml
meeting_intelligence:
  extract_customer_intel: true    # Pain points, requests
  extract_competitive_intel: true # Competitor mentions
  extract_action_items: true      # Always recommended
  extract_decisions: true         # Always recommended
entity_creation:
  mode: auto                      # auto, suggest, or off
```

Internal vs external classification uses your `email_domain` setting. Onboarding writes `auto`; an existing vault with no `entity_creation` setting defaults to `suggest`, whose suggestions appear in `/daily-plan` and `/process-meetings`.

## Manual Sync (Optional)

To force a sync outside the 30-min schedule:

```bash
node .scripts/meeting-intel/sync-from-granola.cjs           # Process now
node .scripts/meeting-intel/sync-from-granola.cjs --dry-run # Preview
node .scripts/meeting-intel/sync-from-granola.cjs --force   # Reprocess today
```

## Stopping Background Sync

```bash
.scripts/meeting-intel/install-automation.sh --stop
```

## Logs

- `.scripts/logs/meeting-intel.log` - Processing log
- `.scripts/logs/meeting-intel.stdout.log` - Standard output
- `.scripts/logs/meeting-intel.stderr.log` - Errors

## Troubleshooting

**No meetings showing up?**
1. Check your Granola API key is connected — run `/granola-setup` if you haven't, or to re-add it
2. Check if background sync is set up: `./install-automation.sh --status`
3. Check logs for errors: `tail -50 .scripts/logs/meeting-intel.stderr.log`

**Mobile recordings not syncing?**
1. Ensure you have a Granola Business plan (required for the API key)
2. Check that the Granola iOS app is syncing to cloud
3. Re-run `/granola-setup` to confirm your API key is still valid

**Background sync not running?**
```bash
cd .scripts/meeting-intel && ./install-automation.sh
```

**Want to re-process meetings?**
```bash
node .scripts/meeting-intel/sync-from-granola.cjs --force
```
