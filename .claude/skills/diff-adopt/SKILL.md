name: diff-adopt
description: "Adopt one shared DexDiff methodology — reads a workflow description, adapts it to your role and vault, and walks you through setup. Use when the user says 'adopt this workflow', 'set me up like this doc'. Not for a full published profile by handle; use `diff-adopt-profile`."
---

## What This Command Does

**In plain English:** Someone figured out a great way to use Dex for a specific job — like prepping for meetings, reviewing deals, or building performance evidence. This command reads their methodology and walks you through setting up a similar workflow in your vault. It adapts to your role, your tools, and your folder structure. Nothing is copied from their system — your Dex generates everything fresh, tailored to you.

**When to use it:**
- Dex suggested a workflow you might like
- You found a workflow on heydex.ai/diff
- Someone shared a methodology URL or file path with you

**How to run it:**
```
/diff-adopt @davekilleen/meeting-intelligence
/diff-adopt https://heydex.ai/diff/davekilleen/meeting-intelligence
/diff-adopt 04-Projects/DexDiff/beta/diffs/meeting-prep.yaml
```

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` - A reference to one methodology document:
- A hosted reference `@<handle>/<diff-id>` - fetch the raw methodology from the API host:
  `GET https://api.heydex.ai/api/diff?author=<handle>&id=<diff-id>`
- A page URL like `https://heydex.ai/diff/<handle>/<diff-id>` - parse out the handle and diff id, then make the same API call. Never WebFetch the page itself: heydex.ai pages are a React app shell and contain no methodology text. The API lives on `api.heydex.ai`; the website host has no `/api/*` routes.
- A local path from the DexDiff draft area, usually under `DEXDIFF_DIFFS_DIR` (default `04-Projects/DexDiff/beta/diffs/meeting-prep.yaml`) (read directly)

The argument is always an explicit location — never a bare name.

Fetch failures must stop the flow with a plain explanation, never silently:
- HTTP 404 - "That workflow was not found. Check the handle and workflow id - the author may have unpublished it."
- Network failure - "Could not reach api.heydex.ai - check your connection and try again. Nothing was changed."
- The response should be a full methodology document carrying `dexdiff_schema: "2.0"`. If it is a short one-line summary instead, say so plainly: "This workflow was published in an old thin format that cannot be regenerated faithfully - ask the author to re-publish it." Do not invent the missing methodology.

If no argument or invalid input:
```
/diff-adopt expects a workflow reference, URL, or file path.

Examples:
  /diff-adopt @davekilleen/meeting-intelligence
  /diff-adopt https://heydex.ai/diff/davekilleen/meeting-intelligence
  /diff-adopt 04-Projects/DexDiff/beta/diffs/meeting-prep.yaml
```

## The Onboarding Flow

This is a guided conversation, not a transaction. Walk the user through each phase. Be warm, clear, and educational. The user may not know what skills, hooks, or CLAUDE.md sections are — explain in plain language what each thing DOES, not what it IS.

---

### Phase 1: Introduce the Job

Read the YAML file and parse it. Confirm `dexdiff_schema: "2.0"`.

Present the workflow by leading with the PROBLEM it solves and what it UNLOCKS — not technical details:

```
[name] — by [author.display_name], [author.role]

THE PROBLEM
[methodology.problem — full text, this is the hook]

WHAT PEOPLE SAY
"[love_letter.text]"
— [love_letter.author]

[love_letter.metrics as bullet points]

WHAT THIS UNLOCKS
After setup, you'll be able to:
  /[command-1]  — [one-line description]
  /[command-2]  — [one-line description]

Want to set this up? [Yes, let's go] [Tell me more first]
```

**If "Tell me more first":** Show `methodology.solution` in full, walk through each command's example output, explain the integrations that enhance it. Then ask again.

**If "Yes, let's go":** Proceed to Phase 2.

---

### Phase 2: Discover Together

Scan the vault and EXPLAIN what you find to the user as you go. This is educational — the user learns about their own setup through the process.

**2a. Understand the user's role**

Check if `System/user-profile.yaml` exists and has a role. If it does, use it. If not, ask:

```
Quick question — what's your role? This helps me tailor the workflow to what matters most to you.

[Show roles from methodology.roles if available, otherwise free text]
```

Look up the matching role in `methodology.roles` to get the adaptation guidance.

**2b. Scan folders**

```
Let me look at your vault structure...

[For each folder in methodology.vault_structure.folders:]
  ✓ [purpose]: Found at [actual path]
  OR
  ○ [purpose]: Not found — I'll create [typical_path] (or suggest a location)
```

**2c. Check integrations**

```
Checking your connected tools...

[For each integration in methodology.integrations:]
  ✓ [name] — connected. [one-line value statement]
  OR
  ○ [name] — not connected. [what the workflow does WITHOUT it]
     (You can add this later with /integrate-mcp)
```

**2d. Check existing skills**

```
Checking for existing workflows...

[For each command in methodology.user_experience.commands:]
  ○ /[name] — you don't have this yet, I'll create it
  OR
  ⚡ /[name] — you already have this! [explain whether to skip, enhance, or replace]
```

**2e. Summarise the discovery**

```
Here's what I found:

  Your role: [role] — I'll frame everything around [adaptation summary]
  Your data: [list connected integrations]
  Missing (but optional): [list unconnected integrations]
  Your folders: [list matched folders with actual paths]
  Existing workflows: [list any that overlap]

Ready to see the plan? [Yes] [I want to adjust something]
```

---

### Phase 3: Customise

Ask the user targeted questions about how they want the workflow to work. Only ask questions where the methodology has genuine choices — don't ask about things that have obvious defaults.

```
A few choices before I set things up:

[For each folder that wasn't found — ask where to create it]
  Where should [purpose] go? [[typical_path]]

[For each behavior where automatic: true]
  [description] — want this to happen automatically? [Yes/No]
  (If yes, I'll set up a hook. If no, I'll add it as a reminder.)

[For conflicting skills]
  You already have /[name]. Want me to enhance it or create a separate one?
```

---

### Phase 4: Preview and Explain

Show what will be created. For each item, explain what it DOES — not just the file path. The user should understand the value of each component.

```
Here's your setup plan:

WORKFLOWS
  /[command-1] — [what it does in plain English]
    Uses: [list data sources it pulls from]
    Framed for: [role] ([adaptation summary])
    Location: .claude/skills/[name]/SKILL.md

  /[command-2] — [what it does in plain English]
    Uses: [list data sources]
    Location: .claude/skills/[name]/SKILL.md

BEHAVIOURS
  [For each approved automatic behavior:]
  After [trigger], Dex will [action].

GUIDANCE
  A "Meeting Workflow" section will be added to your CLAUDE.md so
  Dex always knows when and how to use these workflows.

[If any folders need creating:]
FOLDERS
  + [path] — [purpose]

[If any templates needed:]
TEMPLATES
  + [path] — [purpose]

Ready? [Yes, set it up] [Let me adjust] [Show me the full skill content]
```

If "Show me the full skill content": display the generated SKILL.md text for each skill before creating files.

If "Let me adjust": ask what to change and update the plan.

---

### Phase 5: Build

Once approved, create everything:

1. **Create skill directories and SKILL.md files** — generate each skill tailored to this vault's paths, role adaptation, and available integrations. Every skill should:
   - Use YAML frontmatter with name and description
   - Reference the user's actual folder paths (not methodology typical_paths)
   - Include only integrations that are actually connected
   - Gracefully skip unavailable integrations (check, skip silently)
   - Reflect the role adaptation from methodology.roles

2. **Append CLAUDE.md section** — add a brief section describing the workflow, when to use each command, and any behavioral guidance

3. **Create folders** if needed

4. **Create templates** if needed

5. **Set up hooks** for approved automatic behaviors — create hook scripts in `.claude/hooks/` and register in `.claude/settings.json`

---

### Phase 6: Log the Adoption

Create `.dex/adoptions/[diff-id].json`:

```json
{
  "diff_id": "[id from manifest]",
  "diff_name": "[name from manifest]",
  "adopted_at": "[ISO 8601 timestamp]",
  "source": "[URL or local path]",
  "role": "[user's role]",
  "files_created": [
    "[every file path created]"
  ],
  "folders_created": [
    "[every folder created]"
  ],
  "claude_md_sections": [
    "[section titles added to CLAUDE.md]"
  ],
  "hooks_created": [
    "[hook file paths and settings.json entries]"
  ],
  "skipped": [
    "[anything skipped and why]"
  ],
  "integrations_available": [
    "[integrations that were connected at adoption time]"
  ],
  "integrations_missing": [
    "[integrations that could enhance this later]"
  ]
}
```

Create `.dex/adoptions/` if it doesn't exist.

---

### Phase 7: Walk Through First Use

Don't just confirm — teach the user how to use what was just created. Give them a concrete next action.

```
All set! Here's how your new workflow works:

[For each command created:]
  /[command] — [when to use it, in one sentence]
  Example: /[command] [realistic example for their role]

THE COMPOUND EFFECT
[Explain how the workflow gets better over time — e.g. "Each meeting
builds context for the next one. After a month, your prep briefs
will surface patterns you'd never notice manually."]

WHAT'S NEXT
Try it now:
  /[first command] [suggestion based on their calendar or recent activity]

LATER
  To see what's installed: /diff-list
  To remove this workflow: /diff-remove [diff-id]
  To enhance with more integrations: /integrate-mcp

[If there are missing integrations that would add value:]
TIP: Connect [integration] to unlock [specific value].
Run /integrate-mcp [name] when you're ready.
```

---

## Edge Cases

**Already adopted:** If `.dex/adoptions/[diff-id].json` exists:
```
[name] is already installed (adopted [date]).
Would you like to reinstall it? This will regenerate all skills from
the methodology — useful if you've changed your role or connected new tools.
Your data (meeting notes, people pages, etc.) won't be touched.
```

**Conflicting skill names:** If a skill exists but wasn't created by DexDiff:
```
You already have /[name] — it looks like [brief description of what it does].
  [Enhance it] — I'll add the new capabilities to your existing skill
  [Create separate] — I'll create /[name]-v2 alongside it
  [Skip] — keep your existing one, don't create this
```

**No matching folders:** New or empty vault — propose creating the full structure from methodology.vault_structure.typical_path values. Frame it positively: "Fresh start! I'll set up a clean folder structure for you."

**No role found:** If user-profile.yaml doesn't exist and the methodology has roles, ask. If the methodology has no roles section, skip role adaptation and generate a general-purpose implementation.

---

## Important Rules

- **Never install foreign code.** Everything is generated by the adopter's own AI. The methodology is a specification, not executable content.
- **Never overwrite existing files** without explicit confirmation.
- **Always preview before creating.** The user approves the plan before any files are written.
- **Adapt to the vault.** Use existing folder names and conventions.
- **Adapt to the role.** Use methodology.roles to tailor generated skills.
- **Be educational.** Explain what each component does in plain language. The user should understand their system better after adoption than before.
- **Log everything.** The adoption log is the contract for `/diff-remove`.
- **Suggest next steps.** Always end with a concrete action the user can take right now.

## Inside Dex Desktop Chat (no shell available)

When the tools `mcp__dex-dexdiff__dexdiff_fetch_bundle` and
`mcp__dex-dexdiff__dexdiff_write_adoption` are available (the Dex desktop
app's chat lane, which cannot run shell commands), use them for the fetch and
write steps. Fetch the author's bundle, present only the requested workflow,
and pass just that workflow to `dexdiff_write_adoption`. The preview-consent
conversation stays exactly as described above.
