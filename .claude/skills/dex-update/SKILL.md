description: "Preview and safely adopt a Dex update through the receipt-backed lifecycle (look → back up → apply → verify → rewindable). Use when the user says 'update Dex', 'install the new version', or a release notice appeared. Not for undoing an update; use `dex-rollback`. Not just seeing what changed; use `dex-whats-new`."

# Dex Update

Use this skill when someone wants the latest Dex capabilities or asks what an update would change. Keep the conversation plain and reassuring. The skill collects choices and renders lifecycle results; it never edits, copies, renames, deletes, or merges vault files itself.

## The one route

Every lifecycle operation goes through `core.lifecycle.service` version 1.5.0. Treat its response as authoritative. Do not fall back to direct file operations, Git mutation, an update script, or a hand-built repair when the service refuses.

Use the service operations in this order:

1. Ask `build_and_preview_topology_migration` to check the installed layout as part of the normal update read.
2. If it reports the older combined layout, follow the one-time migration branch below before reading the ordinary update plan.
3. Ask `build_inventory_and_plan` for the verified inventory and ledger-aware plan.
4. Render the five groups below without changing anything.
5. For safe `adopt` items, ask `build_and_preview_adoption` for the exact preview and approval token.
6. For conflict items, collect the choices below. Keep mine and Compare are read-only; Take theirs and Keep both go through `build_and_preview_conflict_resolution`.
7. Show every proposed file from each preview. Execution requires an explicit yes to that exact preview.
8. Pass unchanged adoption previews and tokens to `execute_approved_adoption`, and unchanged resolution previews and tokens to `execute_approved_conflict_resolution`.
9. Ask `read_lifecycle_state` for the verified post-update state and retention warning, then render every receipt.

For a split vault whose update needs new release bytes, never ask the user to
run Git. Before presenting a delivery update, ask `deliver_latest_release`
through `core.lifecycle.service`. It proves the newest immutable release in an
isolated cache, fetches only that pinned tag and its release-channel ref into
Dex's private brain store, then proves the fetched bytes again. This delivery
step does not change vault content.

Only when delivery returns its exact release identity, ask
`build_and_preview_delivered_release` through `core.lifecycle.service` with
that identity. Show every returned write and ask: “Apply this exact update?”
Only a fresh explicit yes to that unchanged preview permits
`execute_approved_delivered_release` with the same preview and approval token.
Render its lifecycle receipt. If delivery, preview, or execution refuses, stop;
no vault-content change was made.

**Immediately after a successful apply, run the post-update canary** — one
read-only walk through the same doors every later command will use. From the
vault root, run `python3 core/health/post_update.py --vault .` (the direct
file path matters: it keeps the canary runnable even when the installed
packages are the thing that broke). Relay its one-line result verbatim. On
failure, treat it as part of this update, not a separate errand: tell the user
plainly that the update applied but something is wrong underneath, and run
`/dex-doctor` now. Never report the update as complete while the canary is
failing.

If the service reports UNKNOWN, conflict, changed evidence, an unsafe path, or a rejected transaction, stop. Explain the refusal in ordinary language and leave the vault untouched. A refusal is a safety result, not an invitation to work around the engine.

## One-time brain and vault upgrade

The topology check can report that this Dex still keeps the product and the user's notes in one combined history. In that case, the service runs the shipped migrator in `dry-run` mode. This only prepares the local report; it does not start the move.

Render the topology preview in the same five groups used for the ordinary update. The proposed move appears under **Needs your review**. Show the complete report returned by the service and explain:

- Dex will separate its own product history from the user's private vault history.
- Notes, tasks, projects, people, and custom additions stay where they are.
- The new private vault history gets no remote, so Dex does not upload it.
- The old combined history becomes the local undo archive named in the final receipt.

Ask: “Make this exact one-time change?” Only an explicit yes to this displayed report authorizes the move. The earlier request to “update Dex” is not approval. Pass the unchanged preview and approval token to `execute_approved_topology_migration`.

The lifecycle service owns the conversion and recovery loop. If the migrator returns exit code 75, the service routes it through resume until the bounded work is complete. Never run `--auto`, `--resume`, or the migrator directly from this skill.

After success, show the topology receipt, including its transaction identifier, final report, undo archive when present, and each auto/resume attempt. Ask `build_and_preview_topology_migration` again and continue with the ordinary update only when it reports the split as complete.

If the dry-run fails, the report changes before approval, approval is missing, conversion stops, or the final split cannot be proved, show the service refusal and stop. Do not improvise a repair.

## One-time local connection refresh

After the topology branch (or at the start of a split-vault update), ask
`build_and_preview_mcp_registration`. This checks whether Dex's own
Customization Migration connection is missing from an older local setup.

- If `needed` is `false`, say that Dex's local connections are already current and continue.
- If `needed` is `true`, show the returned server name and the complete write preview. Explain: “Dex will add this one Dex-owned local connection. It will not replace, remove, or alter any of your existing connections or their settings.” Ask: “Add this exact Dex connection?”
- Only after a fresh explicit yes, pass the unchanged preview and approval token to `execute_approved_mcp_registration`. Render its transaction receipt, including the saved recovery snapshot.

This is the only update route allowed to add this missing Dex-owned registration.
Never edit `.mcp.json` directly, replace an existing server entry, or treat the
earlier update approval as approval for this connection change.

## Deeply customised setup

Before applying an update, use the deep Doctor report to decide whether to offer this branch.
Offer it when `customization_assessment.completeness` is `OK` and
`customization_assessment.identity.customization_count` is at least 1, or when the user says
they have customised Dex heavily. If the verified count is zero, follow the normal lightweight update
path and do not mention this branch. If completeness is `UNKNOWN`, show Doctor's uncertainty
and do not infer a zero count. When Doctor returns `partial: true`, show the observed
records and every exclusion path, reason, and guidance as a partial inventory. Do not
run the Capsule preview or ask for Capsule approval until reassessment returns
completeness `OK`.

### Detect and explain

Render what the assessment found through `/dex-doctor` Step 3b's authority rules, including
all four returned groups. Explain that this journey inventories what the user changed,
preserves the evidence in a protected snapshot called the Capsule, guides the update through
the existing approval flow, and then offers the rebuild with this exact promise: “rebuilds
your customisations on the new version, shows you anything it can't safely carry forward,
and the declared write set is previewed and snapshotted; rewind remains available while its
snapshot is retained among the newest three and the activated files remain unchanged.”

A Capsule is a protected local snapshot of the evidence for every customization. It is stored
under `System/.dex/`, is never uploaded, and survives the update. This is not an automatic
rebuild: candidate planning, staging, activation, and rewind each keep their own authority
boundary.

### Preview and create the Capsule

Run `python3 -m core.customization_migration.cli preview`. Show every returned preview line and
the `preview_sha256` verbatim. Then ask: “Create this exact snapshot?” The earlier request to
“update Dex” is not approval.

Only after a fresh explicit yes, run
`python3 -m core.customization_migration.cli create --confirm-token PREVIEW_SHA256` with the
unchanged digest from that preview. The returned Capsule receipt is authority: render its
`capsule_id`, `file_count`, `byte_count`, and `transaction_id` verbatim. Do not say the
evidence is preserved until that receipt exists.

### Proceed through the normal update

After the Capsule receipt exists, return to the one-route lifecycle above and use its normal
preview and approval flow unchanged. Conflicts still offer Keep mine / Take theirs / Keep both,
with Compare available before the user chooses. Capsule approval never counts as update or
conflict approval.

### Re-check after the update

Read `migration_status_to_dict` through Doctor's `customization_migration_status` section or the
registered Customization Migration MCP status tool. Reproduce the Capsule id, state, validation
status, mismatches, and `pending` flag. Say the Capsule is intact only when its validation status
is `OK`; otherwise say the preserved evidence cannot be verified and follow `/dex-update`
guidance without inventing repair steps.

Run the deep customization assessment again and render it through the Step 3b authority rules.
State plainly which customizations are in `update-replaceable-location` and which are in
`update-untouched-location`. Do not rename those groups or claim that a location predicts an
automatic rebuild.

### Propose the rebuild

Read the Capsule evidence only through the registered MCP. Use
`read_customization_capsule_section` for evidence and
`read_customization_capsule_blob` with the exact Capsule id and SHA-256 for source bytes.
Author candidates only from that evidence and those readable blobs. Classify an item
`manual` when its source is restricted or model-unreadable; never reconstruct it from memory.
Author one canonical candidate in a local scratch file outside the vault named
`CANDIDATE_JSON`. The no-token `stage` command
makes no vault write: it parses the closed candidate shape and delegates to `validate_regeneration_candidate` before it returns a preview. Run that preview before proposing the candidate.
Every customization must have exactly one disposition; never omit an item or use model
confidence as verification.

Present every disposition and its evidence. If an item is blocked or needs manual review,
present one question at a time. Update and revalidate the candidate after each answer. Do not
stage while required questions remain unresolved or exact-set validation refuses the candidate.

### Stage and verify

Run `python3 -m core.customization_migration.cli stage CANDIDATE_JSON` to obtain the private
staging preview. Render every line, including every disposition, future live path, and
`preview_sha256`. Ask: “Stage this exact candidate for verification?” Capsule approval and
update approval do not count.

Only after a fresh explicit yes, run
`python3 -m core.customization_migration.cli stage CANDIDATE_JSON --confirm-token PREVIEW_SHA256`
with the unchanged token. Render the CLI's safe staging receipt summary.

Run `python3 -m core.customization_migration.cli verify CAPSULE_ID PROPOSAL_ID` to preview
the verification verdict and obtain `VERIFICATION_TOKEN`; this makes no verification-report
write. Ask: “Seal this exact verification report?” Only after a fresh explicit yes, run
`python3 -m core.customization_migration.cli verify CAPSULE_ID PROPOSAL_ID --confirm-token VERIFICATION_TOKEN`.
Render only the CLI's safe verification and receipt summaries. Treat a result as
verified only when the engine says `verified`. If the returned per-item value is `manual`, render `manual`; if it is
`unknown`, render `unknown`. Never promote either one, and never describe a blocked report as
complete.

### Preview and activate

Run
`python3 -m core.customization_migration.cli preview-activation CAPSULE_ID PROPOSAL_ID`.
Render every live path, every disposition, the snapshot-retention note, the rewind note, and
`approval_token` verbatim. Ask: “Activate this exact verified rebuild?” A fresh explicit yes
must be bound to the displayed token: an earlier yes is not this yes.

Only after that yes, run
`python3 -m core.customization_migration.cli activate CAPSULE_ID PROPOSAL_ID --confirm-token APPROVAL_TOKEN`.
Render only the CLI's safe activation receipt summary; candidate-controlled free text and
complete file-list payloads are deliberately not printed. Then run
`python3 -m core.customization_migration.cli activation-status CAPSULE_ID` and state rewind
availability only from its returned `rewindable` value.

### Rewind the rebuild

When the user asks to undo the activation, run
`python3 -m core.customization_migration.cli preview-rewind CAPSULE_ID`. Render every restore
path, whether it existed before activation, the reason, and `acknowledgement_token` verbatim.
Explain that rewind restores the exact pre-activation live file state. It does not undo
external actions from manual verification, and it refuses after unsafe live drift or lost
snapshot evidence.

Ask: “Rewind this exact activation?” Only after a fresh explicit yes, run
`python3 -m core.customization_migration.cli rewind CAPSULE_ID --acknowledge-token ACKNOWLEDGEMENT_TOKEN`.
Render the CLI's safe rewind receipt summary, then run
`python3 -m core.customization_migration.cli activation-status CAPSULE_ID` again. Never infer a
successful rewind from command exit alone.

### Interrupted journey

Status and Doctor return an exact phase-specific recovery action for interrupted staging,
interrupted activation, and interrupted rewind. Show the returned phase, Capsule, proposal,
and action verbatim. Ask for a fresh explicit acknowledgement, then run only the returned
`python3 -m core.customization_migration.cli recover --confirm-token RECOVERY_TOKEN` action.
The engine restores the interrupted transaction to its last complete state; re-run status
before continuing the relevant stage, activation, or rewind preview.

A half-created Capsule can instead appear as `recovery-required` or with `UNKNOWN` validation.
Never claim its evidence is preserved before a Capsule receipt exists. Show that status, ask
for a fresh explicit acknowledgement, then route abandonment through
`python3 -m core.customization_migration.cli abandon CAPSULE_ID --acknowledge`. After a
confirmed abandonment, run the preview again and require a new exact-snapshot approval. If
the deterministic adapter refuses any action, show the refusal and stop.

### Customization journey boundaries

- The Customization Migration MCP tools are read-only.
- Capsule creation, abandonment, staging, verification sealing, activation, and rewind happen
  only through the human-confirmed CLI.
- Never search for, edit, delete, or repair Capsule files directly.
- Never use an MCP call, a raw vault write, an earlier approval, or a shortened token as an
  actuation substitute.

## Five-group preview

Always show these groups in this order, even when a group is empty:

1. **New and safe to adopt** — items whose plan action is `adopt`.
2. **Needs your review** — conflicts or customized release files. Say which files caused the hold, then offer the four choices below. Dex leaves each file untouched until the user makes and approves a choice.
3. **Held back by you** — items whose plan action is `skip-held-back`.
4. **Could not be proved** — UNKNOWN items or incomplete lifecycle evidence. Say no change will be made to them.
5. **Already yours** — adopted items and their receipt-backed rewind status.

Example register:

> Here’s exactly what this changes for you. Two items are new and safe, one customized item stays untouched, and everything else is already current.

Do not describe an item as safe merely because its name looks familiar. Use only the action and reasons returned by the service.

## Conflict choices

For each conflicted file, explain that the user changed it and the update carries a new release version. Offer:

- **Keep mine** — “Leave your version exactly as it is. Nothing is written.” Make no service call for this choice.
- **Take theirs** — “Put the new release version live. Your current version remains recoverable with rewind.”
- **Keep both** — “Put the new release version live and save your version beside it as `{name}-custom`, where it stays invocable. The whole change remains rewindable.” Offer this only for a modified skill file. A missing file has nothing to preserve.
- **Compare** — “Show the differences first. Nothing is written.” Read the current and verified release byte sources, render a concise inline diff, then offer the same four choices again. For a large file, summarize the changed regions instead of dumping the whole file.

Collect one `take-theirs` or `keep-both` strategy for each item the user wants resolved. Leave Keep mine items out of the request. Pass only those selected strategies to `build_and_preview_conflict_resolution`, one object per item to resolve, each naming that item and its chosen strategy.

The resolution preview is a separate approval boundary. Show every write exactly as returned, including its path, `release` or `preserved` source, SHA-256, and byte size. Explain which canonical file becomes live and which `-custom` sidecar preserves the user's bytes. Ask: “Apply this exact resolution?” Only an explicit yes to that unchanged preview and approval token permits `execute_approved_conflict_resolution`.

If Keep both is refused because a `{name}-custom` already exists, reassure the user that neither file changed and re-offer Keep mine, Take theirs, or Compare. Never overwrite, rename, merge, or number the existing sidecar.

## Approval

Before execution, show:

- item name and version;
- every file in the preview;
- whether the file is being placed for the first time or refreshed by the authorized lifecycle plan;
- that one crash-safe transaction will apply the complete approved set;
- that the receipt is the source for a later rewind.

Ask one direct question: “Apply this exact update?” for an adoption preview, or “Apply this exact resolution?” for a conflict preview. A vague earlier request to “update Dex” is not approval of a later concrete preview. If anything changes between preview and execution, render the service refusal and build a fresh preview only after the user asks to continue.

## Receipt view

After success, render the receipt returned by `execute_approved_adoption` or `execute_approved_conflict_resolution`:

- adopted items;
- transaction identifier;
- every receipt-declared file;
- snapshot reference;
- rewind acknowledgement availability;
- any retention warning from `read_lifecycle_state`.

Use language such as:

> Update complete. Dex committed one protected transaction and recorded a receipt for every changed file. Your own content was not part of the write set.

Never claim success from a command exit alone. Success means the service returned a committed receipt and the post-update lifecycle state verifies it.

## Boundaries

- Never perform a raw vault write.
- Read-only Compare may render differences, but it must never mutate either byte source.
- Never instruct the user to move files around as part of an update.
- Never bypass a conflict by replacing the customized file.
- Never synthesize, edit, or shorten an approval token or receipt.
- Never treat an update receipt as permission to rewind; rollback has its own exact acknowledgement.
- For a legacy install that cannot activate the service, explain that the compatibility bridge or installer must complete first. Do not recreate that bridge manually.

The user should see choices, consequences, and receipts. The lifecycle service owns every mutation.
