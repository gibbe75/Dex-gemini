# Daily Review - Agent Instructions

You are gathering context for a daily review. Collect data from all available
sources, then write a DRAFT review file. You gather evidence; you do not make
the assessments the user should be part of. Interactive sections are left as
placeholders for the main conversation to complete. Be direct and concise. Skip
any section gracefully if a tool fails; never error out.

**Target date:** {{TARGET_DATE}} ({{DAY_NAME}}, {{MONTH}} {{DD}}, {{YYYY}})

**Note:** PostToolUse hooks from the parent skill do not fire in this subagent
context. Do not rely on hook-driven side effects for any write you make.

---

## Step 0: Meeting Catch-Up (not same-day only)

Check for meetings that have not yet been processed. Read `meeting_sources` in
`System/user-profile.yaml` first, using the exact validation, vault-boundary,
source-order, and degradation rules in
`.claude/skills/process-meetings/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`. The profile records
provenance and a local folder; it does not grant access to an external recorder.

Process every unprocessed meeting since the last one that did, NOT only
{{TARGET_DATE}}. Compute that catch-up window from dated notes across the valid
configured `notes_folder` and `00-Inbox/Meetings/`, not from the default folder
alone. If no dated local note exists, use the most recent seven days. If the
window is wider than seven days, process the most recent seven days and REPORT
the older backlog rather than silently skipping it.

Why the window matters: a same-day filter loses meetings permanently on any day
the review does not run.

Process local candidates following the process-meetings instructions, including
provider-neutral discovery and updating person pages directly rather than
counting on a hook. Note the actual path of every meeting processed. If the
profile is missing or malformed, report that once and use the safe local
fallback. If nothing is unprocessed, skip silently.

---

## Step 1: File Discovery

From the vault root, find files modified on the target date:

```bash
find . -type f -name "*.md" -newermt "{{TARGET_DATE}} 00:00:00" ! -newermt "{{TARGET_DATE}} 23:59:59" 2>/dev/null | grep -v node_modules | grep -v .git
```

List ALL modified files, without truncation.

---

## Step 2: Gather Context

### 2.1 Tasks

Read `03-Tasks/Tasks.md` and extract:
- Tasks completed on the target date (lines containing `{{TARGET_DATE}}` with
  done markers)
- Tasks started but not finished (status `s`)
- Tasks blocked (status `b`)

### 2.2 Weekly Priorities

Call `get_week_progress()` for priority status and how the day connects to
weekly goals. Also call `get_week_priorities()` for the full list.

### 2.3 Meetings

Use the actual meeting paths returned by Step 0, then check both the valid
configured notes folder and `00-Inbox/Meetings/{{TARGET_DATE}}/` for additional
local meeting notes. Also call `calendar_get_today()` for the calendar view.
Calendar events are scheduling evidence, not meeting-note content. Combine the
local notes with any manually created notes without widening into an external
notes service.

Apply CLAUDE.md's **Calendar response confidence contract** before consuming
events or passing them to `analyze_calendar_capacity`.

### 2.4 Semantic Context Enrichment (if QMD available)

Check the QMD `status` tool. If available:

1. **Map completed tasks to goals:** for each task completed today, `query`
   with the task description; look for connections to quarterly goals or weekly
   priorities that keyword matching misses.
2. **Enrich meeting context:** for each meeting today, `query` with the meeting
   topic for related past discussions.
3. **Priority alignment check:** for each weekly priority, `query` for today's
   work that advanced it.

Only note genuinely new connections. If QMD is unavailable, skip silently.

### 2.5 Reminders Completion Sync

1. Call `reminders_list_completed(list_name="Dex Today")`
2. For each completed reminder, match to a task by title and call
   `update_task_status(task_title="...", status="d")`; record what was synced
3. For each task completed today in the vault, call
   `reminders_find_and_complete(list_name="Dex Today", title_query="...")`
4. Call `reminders_clear_completed(list_name="Dex Today")`

If the Reminders tools are unavailable, skip silently.

### 2.6 Email End-of-Day Review (if connected)

Check `System/integrations/config.yaml`. If an email integration is enabled and
its MCP is healthy:

1. Get today's received and sent emails
2. Analyse: counts, received emails with no matching reply (needs response),
   sent emails awaiting a response, action items in received mail ("Can
   you...", "Please...", "By Friday..."), outbound promises in sent mail
   ("I'll send...", "Will follow up...")
3. Cross-reference senders with `lookup_person()` and promises against
   `03-Tasks/Tasks.md`
4. Record the summary for the review file

If not connected or unhealthy, skip silently.

---

## Step 3: Daily Plan Completion Tracking

1. Read `07-Archives/Plans/{{TARGET_DATE}}.md` if it exists
2. Extract the planned focus items from "Today's Focus"
3. For each, check `03-Tasks/Tasks.md` completion timestamps and the modified
   files for evidence; classify as Complete, In Progress (estimate %), or Not
   Started; calculate the completion rate
4. Identify significant work done today that was NOT in the plan

---

## Step 4: Progress Assessment (evidence only)

Synthesise from the gathered context: what was accomplished, what moved against
weekly priorities, what got stuck, what unexpected things came up, and any
connections discovered. Report evidence and flag contradictions; leave
judgement calls to the conversation.

---

## Step 5: Week Progress Check

Call `get_week_progress()`. Record the status of each weekly priority, days
remaining, and which priorities need attention tomorrow.

---

## Step 6: Tomorrow's Shape

Call `analyze_calendar_capacity(days_ahead=1)` and/or:

```
calendar_get_events_with_attendees(start_date="{{TOMORROW_DATE}}", end_date="{{TOMORROW_DATE_PLUS_1}}")
```

Record: meeting count, free blocks, day type (stacked / moderate / open).

---

## Write the Draft Review File

Using the Write tool, create:
`07-Archives/Reviews/Daily_Review_{{TARGET_DATE}}.md`

Use the review template from this skill's `SKILL.md` (Output Format section):
frontmatter with `plan_completion_rate`, Plan vs. Reality, Accomplished,
Progress Made, Weekly Priorities Progress, Meeting Follow-Ups, Insights,
Blocked/Stuck, Discovered Questions, Tomorrow's Focus, Open Loops. Add an Email
Summary section only when email data was gathered.

**Reading `SKILL.md` safely.** You need only the section named above. Ignore that
file's "Delegated gathering" section entirely: it describes how you were
invoked. You ARE the subagent, so you must never call the Agent tool or spawn a
subagent of your own.

**Output rules:**
- Omit any section where no data was available
- Use real data for every section you have data for
- Leave placeholder markers ONLY for `Meeting Follow-Ups` and `Tomorrow's
  Focus`; mark them `<!-- PLACEHOLDER: interactive step will complete this -->`
  with suggested content where the data supports it
- Be direct and concise; bullet points, not paragraphs

---

## Final Output

After writing the draft, return a structured summary:

```
AGENT COMPLETE

Draft review written: 07-Archives/Reviews/Daily_Review_{{TARGET_DATE}}.md

Summary:
- Meetings processed in catch-up: [N] (window: [dates]; older backlog: [N or none])
- Files modified today: [N]
- Tasks completed: [N]
- Plan completion rate: [X]%
- Weekly priorities status: [brief]
- Emails: [X] received, [Y] sent, [Z] need reply (or "not connected")
- Reminders synced: [N]
- Semantic connections found: [N]
- Sections needing interactive input: Meeting Follow-Ups, Tomorrow's Focus

[Any warnings or issues encountered]
```

This summary tells the conversation what to focus on in the interactive steps.
