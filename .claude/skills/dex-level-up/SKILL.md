name: dex-level-up
description: "Surface Dex features the user isn't using yet, based on their usage patterns. Use when the user says 'what am I missing', 'show me new features', 'level up my Dex'. Not for diagnosing what's broken; use `dex-doctor`. Not for what changed in a release; use `dex-whats-new`."
---

## Purpose

Discover Dex capabilities you haven't used yet. No FOMO — this is your concierge showing you what's available so you can get full value from the system without missing features.

---

## Step 1: Check Usage Log

Read `System/usage_log.md` to understand what features the user has adopted.

---

## Step 2: Analyze Patterns

Look for natural progressions and gaps:

### Progression Patterns

**Daily → Weekly → Quarterly:**
- Using `/daily-plan` but not `/week-plan`? → Suggest weekly planning
- Using `/week-plan` but not `/quarter-plan`? → Suggest quarterly goals

**Meeting Capture → Relationship Tracking:**
- Processing meetings but no person pages? → Suggest person pages
- Have person pages but not company pages? → Suggest processing meetings to auto-create company pages in 05-Areas/Companies/

**Tasks → Projects:**
- Managing tasks but no project pages? → Suggest project tracking
- Have projects but not using `/project-health`? → Suggest health checks

**Basic → Advanced:**
- Comfortable with core workflows? → Suggest journaling, learning capture
- Using all features consistently? → Suggest custom MCPs, system improvements

### Role-Based Relevance

Prioritize suggestions based on user's role (from `System/user-profile.yaml`):

**Product Managers:**
- `/product-brief` for feature ideation
- Project tracking for initiative management
- Relationship tracking for stakeholder management

**Engineering:**
- Project tracking for sprint/milestone management

**Sales/Customer Success:**
- Person pages for customer context
- Relationship tracking for account management
- Meeting prep for sales calls

**Leadership:**
- Quarterly planning for strategic thinking
- Weekly reviews for team synthesis
- Learning capture for pattern recognition

---

## Step 2.5: Check for Role-Specific Skills

After analyzing universal feature usage, check for role-specific skills:

### Identify User's Role Group

1. Read `System/user-profile.yaml` → `role` field
2. Map role to role_group using this mapping:
   - **product:** Product Manager, CPO, Product Ops, Fractional CPO
   - **sales:** Sales, Account Executive, CRO, RevOps
   - **marketing:** Marketing, CMO
   - **finance:** Finance, CFO
   - **engineering:** Engineering, CTO, Solutions Engineering
   - **customer_success:** Customer Success, CCO
   - **operations:** Product Ops, RevOps, BizOps, Data/Analytics
   - **leadership:** CEO, Founder, C-Suite roles
   - **design:** Design
   - **support:** People (HR), Legal, IT Support, CHRO, CLO, CIO, CISO
   - **advisory:** Consultant, Coach, Venture Capital/Private Equity

### Check Available Skills

1. List files in `.claude/skills/_available/[role_group]/`
2. For each available skill directory, read its SKILL.md and extract:
   - name (from frontmatter)
   - description (from frontmatter)
   - jtbd (from frontmatter)
   - time_investment (from frontmatter)

### Check Installed Skills

1. List files in `.claude/skills/`
2. Cross-reference with available skills to determine which are not yet installed

### Present Role Skills (if any uninstalled)

If there are uninstalled role-specific skills, include this section in the output:

```markdown
---

## 💼 Role-Specific Skills for [Role Name]

You haven't installed role-specific skills yet. Here's what's available for [role_group] roles:

### /[skill-name]
**Job to be done:** [JTBD from frontmatter]
**Time investment:** [time_investment from frontmatter]

[Repeat for each available uninstalled skill]

---

**Want to install these skills?** 

Say:
- **"install all"** to add all [X] skills
- **"install [skill-name]"** to add specific skills
- **"tell me more about [skill-name]"** to learn more before installing
```

### Official Capability Adoption

When the user says "install [skill]" or "install all", keep acting as a concierge and renderer. Every adoption goes through `core.lifecycle.service` version 1.0.0; this skill never writes, moves, or installs capability files itself.

1. Ask `build_inventory_and_plan` for the verified catalog plan. A dormant role skill is eligible only when its exact item id appears in that official plan. A skill from `.claude/skills-custom/`, another user-created location, or an unregistered source is not an official catalog item and must not be adopted through this route.
2. Render the catalog result in the same five-group order used by Dex Doctor and Dex Update, even when a group is empty:
   1. **New and safe to adopt** — action `adopt`
   2. **Needs your review** — action `conflict`; name the files Dex preserved
   3. **Held back by you** — action `skip-held-back`
   4. **Could not be proved** — action `unknown`; say no change will be made
   5. **Already yours** — action `already-adopted`, with its receipt-backed state
3. For the selected official item ids, ask `build_and_preview_adoption` for the exact preview and approval token. For "install all", request only the eligible official items the user was shown; a held-back or unproved item never changes the others.
4. Show the item name and version, every proposed file, whether each file is new or refreshed, and that vault-owned user files are outside the write set. Explain that the complete approved set will be one crash-safe transaction with a receipt that can support an exact rewind.
5. Ask one direct confirmation: “Adopt this exact capability preview?” An earlier request to install is not approval of a later concrete file list. If the preview or evidence changes, render the refusal and request a fresh preview instead of working around it.
6. Only after explicit confirmation, pass the unchanged preview and token to `execute_approved_adoption`. Do not synthesize, shorten, or reuse either value.
7. Ask `read_lifecycle_state` for the verified post-adoption state. Render the returned receipt: adopted items, transaction identifier, every receipt-declared file, snapshot reference, rewind acknowledgement availability, and any retention warning. Confirm installation only when the service returned a committed receipt and the refreshed state reports the item as adopted.

If the service refuses, explain why in ordinary language and stop with the vault untouched. There is no manual fallback. In a fresh session, normal presence-based skill discovery resolves the adopted capability from its service-written path; do not hand-wire activation, edit capability configuration, or create a second installation path.

---

## Step 3: Integration Discovery

Check for connected integrations and surface opportunities the user may be missing.

### Unused Capabilities (Already Connected)

Read `System/integrations/config.yaml` and check each enabled integration for underutilized features:

**For each enabled integration, check if all capabilities are active:**

- **Gmail connected** but `email_followup: false`?
  → "You have Gmail connected but haven't enabled follow-up detection. It flags emails waiting for replies — useful in `/daily-plan`."

- **Gmail connected** but `newsletter_digest: false`?
  → "Gmail is connected but newsletter digests aren't enabled. It summarizes your morning newsletters so you can skim instead of read."

- **Todoist/Things connected** but `/process-inbox` doesn't route to it?
  → "You have [Tool] connected but inbox processing doesn't route tasks to it yet. Want to enable two-way sync so tasks land in both places?"

- **Jira connected** but `sprint_tracking: false`?
  → "Jira is connected but sprint tracking isn't active. It would pull sprint items into your `/daily-plan`."

- **Zoom connected** but Granola also active?
  → "You have both Zoom and Granola — Granola already captures meetings. Zoom's main added value is scheduling. Working as expected?"

Present any findings as a section:

```markdown
## Untapped Integration Features

You have [X] integrations connected. Here are features you haven't turned on yet:

- **Gmail follow-up detection** — Surfaces emails waiting for replies in your daily plan.
  → Enable: Edit `System/integrations/config.yaml` → `google-workspace.email_followup: true`

- **[Other unused feature]** — [Brief value prop].
  → Enable: [Specific instruction]
```

If all features of all connected integrations are active, skip this section.

### Missing Integrations (Not Connected)

Run the integration concierge to find tools the user already works with but hasn't connected — it scans the vault for signals (mentions, links, email domains) and ranks them:

```bash
node .claude/hooks/integration-concierge.cjs
```

Parse the JSON output — the high_value tier holds items scoring 5 or higher, moderate_value holds the rest with any signal. Each entry carries a `reason` field naming the strongest evidence ("installed on your Mac", "already set up as an MCP server but not connected yet", or a mention count). Surface up to two, named specifically, using that reason:

```markdown
## Tools You Could Connect

- **[shortName]** — [reason]. [value proposition]. Connect with `[setup]` ([setupTime]).
```

Lead with the high_value items; fall back to a single role-fit moderate_value suggestion only if there are no high_value hits. If nothing scores, don't force it — a generic "run `/integrate-mcp` to connect calendar, email, task apps (Todoist/Things/Trello), and more" line is enough. Keep it to high-signal suggestions only — don't overwhelm.

---

## Step 4: Generate Recommendations

Show **2-3 specific, actionable suggestions** ranked by:

1. **Natural next step:** Builds on what they're already doing
2. **High value:** Would significantly improve their workflow
3. **Low friction:** Easy to try without disrupting flow

### Recommendation Format

For each suggestion:

```markdown
### {{Feature Name}} - {{Why it matters}}

**What you're missing:** {{Brief explanation}}

**Why now:** {{Why this is relevant based on their usage}}

**How to start:** {{Specific command or action}}

**Time investment:** {{2 minutes / 10 minutes / ongoing}}
```

---

## Step 5: Present Recommendations

Display in this format:

```markdown
# 🚀 Level Up Your Dex System

Based on your usage, here are **{{X}} ways to get more value** from Dex:

---

## 1. {{Feature Name}}

**What you're missing:** {{Explanation}}

**Why it's relevant:** {{Context from their usage}}

**How to start:** {{Command or action}}

**Time:** {{Investment}}

---

## 2. {{Feature Name}}

[Same format]

---

## 3. {{Feature Name}}

[Same format]

---

## Want to try one now?

Just say the number or feature name, and I'll guide you through it.

---

*Run `/dex-level-up` anytime to see what else you might be missing.*
```

---

## Step 6: Track Adoption (Silent)

When user tries a recommended feature, silently update `System/usage_log.md` by checking the box for that feature.

**Update triggers:**
- User runs a command → Check command box
- User creates person page → Check person page box
- User creates project → Check project tracking box
- Work MCP tools used → Check task boxes
- **A lifecycle receipt proves a role-specific skill was adopted** → Check "Installed" box in Role-Specific Skills section
- **User runs role-specific skill** → Check "Used" box in Role-Specific Skills section

**Update method:**
- Simple find/replace: `- [ ] Feature` → `- [x] Feature`
- No announcement needed

**Role-Specific Skills Tracking:**

After the lifecycle receipt proves a role-specific skill was adopted, add it to `System/usage_log.md` if the "Role-Specific Skills" section doesn't exist. The usage log records what happened; it is never installation authority:

```markdown
## Role-Specific Skills

**Installed:**
- [x] /[skill-name]

**Used:**
- [ ] /[skill-name]
```

If section exists, just check the appropriate boxes for the skill.

## Examples

### Example 1: Daily User, No Weekly Planning

```markdown
# 🚀 Level Up Your Dex System

Based on your usage, here are **3 ways to get more value** from Dex:

---

## 1. Weekly Planning - Think Bigger Picture

**What you're missing:** You've been crushing daily plans (42 days straight! 🔥), but you're planning day-to-day without a weekly view. Weekly planning helps you think bigger than today's tasks.

**Why it's relevant:** Consistent daily planning shows you value structure. Weekly planning is the natural next step — it makes your daily plans even better because you're working toward clear weekly outcomes.

**How to start:** Run `/week-plan` on Monday morning (or Friday evening). Set your Top 3 priorities for the week. Then when you run `/daily-plan`, I'll show how today's work connects to those weekly goals.

**Time:** 5-10 minutes once per week

---

## 2. Person Pages - Never Walk Into Meetings Cold

**What you're missing:** You mention people in your notes, but you don't have person pages yet. Person pages aggregate everything about someone — meeting history, open items, context — so you're never scrambling before calls.

**Why it's relevant:** You have 12 meetings this week. Right now, you're probably trying to remember what you discussed last time. With person pages, I can show you that context automatically in `/daily-plan` and `/meeting-prep`.

**How to start:** Just say "Create a person page for [name]" and I'll set it up. Or next time you mention someone in a meeting note, I'll offer to create their page automatically.

**Time:** 2 minutes per person, one-time setup

---

## 3. Weekly Review - Spot Patterns You're Missing

**What you're missing:** You're planning every week, but you're not reviewing what happened. Weekly reviews help you spot patterns (energy, challenges, wins) that aren't obvious day-to-day.

**Why it's relevant:** After 6 weeks of weekly planning, you have data. A weekly review surfaces insights like "I'm always blocked on Fridays" or "My best work happens Tuesday mornings." That knowledge helps you plan better.

**How to start:** Run `/week-review` on Friday afternoon or Sunday evening. I'll analyze your week, show patterns, and suggest adjustments.

**Time:** 10-15 minutes once per week

---

```

### Example 2: Power User, Advanced Features

```markdown
# 🚀 Level Up Your Dex System

You're using Dex like a pro. Here are **2 advanced features** that could push your system even further:

---

## 1. Custom MCP Integration - Connect Your CRM

**What you're missing:** You're tracking relationships manually, but your CRM already has this data. A custom MCP could sync deal status, contact info, and interaction history automatically.

**Why it's relevant:** You've built 23 person pages and you're consistent with relationship tracking. Automating the data sync would save you 15-20 minutes per week and ensure your Dex system stays in sync with your CRM.

**How to start:** Run `/create-mcp` and tell me which CRM you use (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.). I'll guide you through creating a custom MCP server that pulls data automatically.

**Time:** 30-45 minutes setup, saves 15-20 min/week ongoing

---

## 2. Learning Synthesis - Turn Experience Into Knowledge

**What you're missing:** You've captured 47 session learnings, but you haven't synthesized them into durable knowledge yet. Learning synthesis turns "I made this mistake" into "Here's the principle I learned."

**Why it's relevant:** You have a goldmine of captured experience. Running `/save-insight` regularly would turn those raw learnings into a knowledge base you can reference and share.

**How to start:** Run `/save-insight` after finishing a complex project or at the end of each month. I'll help you extract patterns from your session learnings and write them into `06-Resources/Learnings/`.

**Time:** 10 minutes per insight, quarterly or as-needed

---

## Want to try one now?

Just say the number or feature name, and I'll guide you through it.
```

## Special Cases

### If Usage Log is Empty

> "Looks like you're just getting started! Let me show you the core workflows that most people find valuable first..."

Then show the essentials:
1. Daily planning
2. Task management
3. Meeting capture

### If Everything is Checked

> "You're using every feature in Dex! 🎉
> 
> At this point, consider:
> - Building custom MCPs for your specific workflow
> - Running `/dex-improve` to suggest system enhancements
> - Sharing what you've learned — your setup could help others"

### If User Says "Show Me Everything"

> "I could, but that's overwhelming. Let me show you the next 2-3 features that make sense based on where you are.
> 
> If you want to browse everything, check out:
> - `CLAUDE.md` for the full system overview
> - `.claude/commands/` folder for all available commands
> - `06-Resources/Dex_System/Dex_System_Guide.md` for the complete guide"

---

## Capturing Your Own Ideas

After showing recommendations, also mention:

> ---
> 
> **💡 Have your own ideas for improving Dex?**
> 
> Use the `capture_idea` MCP tool anytime you think "I wish Dex did X".
> 
> Your ideas get ranked by:
> - Impact on your daily workflow
> - Fit with your usage patterns
> - Implementation effort
> - Synergy with existing features
> 
> Run `/dex-backlog` to see your ideas ranked, or `/dex-improve` to workshop one.
> 
> *The system helps you systematically improve your PKM over time.*

---

## Integration with Other Commands

### In `/daily-plan`:

If user hasn't run `/dex-level-up` in 7+ days and has unused features, add a gentle nudge:

```markdown
---

💡 **Tip:** You're using {{X}} of {{Y}} Dex features. Run `/dex-level-up` to see what you might be missing.
```

### After Onboarding:

At the end of `/setup`, mention:

> "One more thing: run `/dex-level-up` anytime to discover features you haven't tried yet. No FOMO — just helpful guidance on what's available."

---

## Track Usage (Silent)

**Analytics (Silent):**

Call `track_event` with event_name `level_up_viewed` and properties:
- `features_suggested`
- `features_unknown_count`

This only fires if the user has opted into analytics. No action needed if it returns "analytics_disabled".

---

## Philosophy

This command exists to reduce **feature blindness** — when users don't know what they don't know.

**Not pushy:** Only suggest 2-3 things at a time
**Contextual:** Based on their actual usage patterns
**Progressive:** Natural next steps, not overwhelming options
**Helpful:** Genuine concierge service, not annoying nudges

The goal: Get users to full value as fast as possible without interrupting their flow.
