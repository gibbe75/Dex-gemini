# Keep CLAUDE.md in step with CLAUDE-custom.md — runs on every user message.
#
# Why every message rather than a session boundary: composition previously ran
# only inside the update transaction, so a personal instruction did nothing
# until the next update. Anything tied to a boundary event inherits the user's
# habits — and this is already a bug about inheriting the user's habits. A
# session-end trigger was tried first and rejected: it does not fire once
# during a long working session, which is exactly when people edit their
# instructions.
#
# Hard rules, matching health-pulse.sh:
#   - The everyday path is two stat calls in bash builtins. No forks, no
#     interpreter start, nothing to notice.
#   - Python starts ONLY when CLAUDE-custom.md is genuinely newer. On this
#     machine that was three times in eight hours; an interpreter start costs
#     ~19 ms against a model round-trip measured in hundreds.
#   - Any failure is silent. exit 0 always. A vault that cannot recompose is
#     no worse off than before this hook existed, and /dex-doctor reports it.
#   - Never a partial write: the Python side composes to a temp file and
#     renames, so a half-written instruction file is impossible.
#   - Never a competing write: the Python side takes the vault mutation lock
#     before composing, and gives up quietly if another Dex process holds it.
#     An update composes CLAUDE.md itself, so nothing is lost by waiting, and
#     racing it would overwrite the new file using the old release template.
#   - This path is mtime-gated, so it cannot repair a CLAUDE.md that is newer
#     than the custom block and still wrong. That case is Doctor's, which
#     forces on bytes. Do not point a user here to fix drift.
