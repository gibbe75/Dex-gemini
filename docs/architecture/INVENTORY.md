Use when the user says 'connect Pipedrive', 'link my CRM', 'sync my pipeline with Pipedrive'. Not for pipeline analysis without a CRM; use `pipeline-health`. Not for reconciling an already-connected CRM; use `pipeline-sync`. | 303 | when |
| `pipeline-sync` | `.claude/skills/pipeline-sync/SKILL.md` | Live view of your Pipedrive pipeline reconciled against your local pipeline tracker; flags drift, maps focus deals, and pushes confirmed updates to the CRM. Use when the user says 'sync my pipeline', 'show me my pipeline', 'reconcile the CRM'. Not for connecting Pipedrive in the first place; use `pipedrive-setup`. | 315 | when |
| `process-meetings` | `.claude/skills/process-meetings/SKILL.md` | Turn synced meetings into updated person pages, extracted tasks and organized notes.

Not for prepping an upcoming meeting; use `meeting-prep`. | 293 | when |
| `product-brief` | `.claude/skills/product-brief/SKILL.md` | Extract a product idea through guided questions and generate a PRD. Use when the user says 'write a PRD', 'spec this feature', 'turn this idea into a brief'. Not for a non-product initiative like hiring or partnerships (use `initiative-kickoff` once shipped); not for checking existing projects' status (use `project-health`). | 326 | when |
| `project-health` | `.claude/skills/project-health/SKILL.md` | Scan active projects for status, blockers and next actions. Use when the user says 'how are my projects', 'what's stuck', 'project status'. Also use proactively when projects have gone quiet. Not for writing a spec for a new product idea; use `product-brief`. | 259 | when |
| `prompt-improver` | `.claude/skills/prompt-improver/SKILL.md` | Rewrite a vague prompt into a rich, structured one, with automatic fallback. Use when the user says 'improve this prompt', 'make this prompt better', or hands over a thin instruction. Not for creating a reusable skill; use `create-skill`. | 238 | when |
| `relationship-radar` | `.claude/skills/relationship-radar/SKILL.md` | Spot the relationships going cold — people you were in regular contact with and haven't touched in a while, and important contacts who are slipping — ranked by how stale each has become, so you can reconnect before it costs you. Use when the user says 'who should I reach out to', 'who am I losing touch with', 'who's going cold', 'who needs attention', or during a weekly review. Also use proactively when someone important hasn't come up in a long time. Not for prepping a specific upcoming meeting; use `meeting-prep`. Not for specific promises you owe people; use `commitments`. | 582 | when |
| `reset` | `.claude/skills/reset/SKILL.md` | Restructure an existing Dex vault for a new role or changed preferences, without losing data. Use when the user says 'I changed jobs', 'restructure my Dex', 'my role is different now'. Not for first-time setup; use `setup`. Not for just toggling one feature; use `manage-capabilities`. | 285 | when |
| `review` | `.claude/skills/review/SKILL.md` | Deprecation alias for `daily-review`. The end-of-day review was renamed; `/review` now redirects to `daily-review` and will be removed after one release. Use when the user types `/review` out of habit — hand straight off to `daily-review`, which owns end-of-day review and learning capture. Not for running the review here; use `daily-review`. | 343 | when |
| `save-insight` | `.claude/skills/save-insight/SKILL.md` | Capture a reusable learning from completed work so future similar work is easier. Use when the user says 'save this learning', 'capture this insight', or finishes something tricky. Also use proactively after non-routine work. Not for recording a *decision* and its rationale; use `decision-log`. | 295 | when |

Use when the user says 'scrape', 'pull data from this URL', 'extract from this site'. Not for meaning-based search of the user's own vault; use `enable-semantic-search`. | 264 | when |
| `setup` | `.claude/skills/setup/SKILL.md` | Run first-time Dex onboarding: build the vault structure, capture the user profile and configure MCPs. Use when `System/.onboarding-complete` is absent or the user says 'set up Dex', 'start onboarding'. Not for the post-onboarding tour; use `getting-started`. Not for a mid-life role change; use `reset`. | 304 | when |
| `skill-score` | `.claude/skills/skill-score/SKILL.md` | Grade a Dex skill against the shape-aware quality rubric and report a ship/revise/no verdict with the exact fixes. Use when you finish writing or editing a skill, when create-skill hands off a new package, before shipping a first-party skill, or when the user asks "is this skill any good / will it fire / score my skill". Also use proactively right after any SKILL.md is created or its description changes. Not for authoring a new skill from scratch (use create-skill) or fixing broken YAML frontmatter alone (create-skill's validator does that); skill-score judges architecture and routing, not just format. | 609 | when |
| `things-setup` | `.claude/skills/things-setup/SKILL.md` | Connect Things 3 (macOS only) so Dex reads and updates your Things tasks. Use when the user says 'I use Things', 'sync my Things inbox', or pastes a `things://` link. Not for Todoist (`todoist-setup`) or Trello (`trello-setup`). | 228 | when |

Use when the user says 'clean up my inbox', 'triage', 'sort out these notes'. Also use proactively when `00-Inbox/` is piling up. Not for updating notes from meetings; use `process-meetings`. | 312 | when |
| `week-plan` | `.claude/skills/week-plan/SKILL.md` | Set the week's priorities against goals, calendar shape and task effort. Use when the user says 'plan my week', 'what should I focus on this week', or on their first working day. Also use proactively at the first session of a new week. Not for reviewing the week just past; use `week-review`. | 292 | when |
| `week-review` | `.claude/skills/week-review/SKILL.md` | Review the week with concrete accomplishments (not fake percentages), pattern detection and goal tracking. Use when the user says 'how was my week', 'week review', or it's their last working day. Also use proactively when a week's priorities are largely resolved. Not for planning the coming week; use `week-plan`. | 314 | when |
| `weekly-reflection` | `.claude/skills/weekly-reflection/SKILL.md` | A short guided reflection on what energized you, what drained you, and one change for next week.
