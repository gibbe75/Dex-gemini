# Connection-manager live-account gate — runbook + first-run results (2026-07-24)

The shipping gate for the connections engine (`core/integrations/connection-manager/`): prove
connect → use → break → detect → reconnect against REAL provider accounts. The first run passed
2026-07-24 with tester-owned accounts on the PR #209 engine. The post-Phase-2/3 Google + Linear
rerun also passed on 2026-07-24 against PR #221. Re-run this after any change to the OAuth flow,
refresh path, token store, health judgment, or signed presence host.

The engine code ships in Core, but the product doorway does not. `/connect` is implemented only on
held draft PR #231 and must not merge while the Phase 5e security verdict remains no-go. This
runbook is a maintainer gate, not user-facing setup.

## Setup

- An OS-bound signed Dex host that supplies the trusted presence provider. Bare
  Core intentionally fails first connect closed; environment command/optional
  switches are not an acceptable substitute.
- Dedicated gate vault (never the live vault): `DEX_VAULT=/path/to/dedicated/cm-live-gate-vault`
- A Google OAuth client (type Desktop app) in any project the tester controls; Calendar API enabled;
  tester's account added as test user. Register via `connect.cjs register-app google`: an
  interactive terminal visibly asks for the client id and hides the secret. Automation may pipe
  id + secret on separate lines.
- A Linear personal API key for Class B.

## The battery (Class A — OAuth, run the loop TWICE)

1. `connect google --scopes .../calendar.readonly` → browser PKCE flow (5-min callback window).
2. `status` → 🟢 connected.
3. `get-token.cjs google` → default output must contain ONLY access_token + expires_at (exit 0).
4. `dex-call.cjs google /calendar/v3/users/me/calendarList` → real data.
5. `refresh google --force` → network refresh succeeds.
6. Encrypted-at-rest: token file is a v2 envelope `{v:2, aad:"token:google", iv, tag, data}`,
   no plaintext token substrings.
7. BREAK: revoke the grant. UI path: myaccount.google.com/connections → the app (named by the
   project's CONSENT SCREEN, not the client — see trap below). Deterministic path:
   `curl -X POST https://oauth2.googleapis.com/revoke -d "token=<refresh_token>"` (HTTP 200).
8. `refresh google --force` → must FAIL with `invalid_grant` (exit 1);
   `status` → 🔴 needs_reauth (invalid_grant); `get-token` → exit 3.
9. `dex-call` while broken → refuses with "needs re-authentication. Run: connect google".
10. RECONNECT: `connect google` again → 🟢, data flows.

## Class B (paste-a-key — Linear)

1. `set-key linear` (stdin only) → probe → 🟢.
2. `dex-call.cjs linear /graphql POST --body '{"query":"{ viewer { name } }"}'` → real identity.
3. Encrypted-at-rest: v2 envelope, aad `token:linear`, no `lin_api` substring.
4. `get-token.cjs linear` → rendered request envelope (kind api_key + headers), never the raw key.
5. BREAK: delete the key in Linear → API returns 401 AUTHENTICATION_ERROR.
6. RECONNECT: new key via `set-key linear` → data flows.

## First-run results (2026-07-24)

- Class A: full loop passed TWICE consecutively. Break detection exact: forced refresh → 400
  invalid_grant → needs_reauth stamped → get-token exit 3 → honest refusal downstream.
- Class B: loop passed once (creation probe + live read + break + reconnect).
- Multi-account live test SKIPPED — isolation is covered by the offline suite
  (`connection-manager.test.cjs` multi-account tests); exercise live when a second real account
  is convenient.

## Current release state

1. **Resolved in Phase 2:** Google, Slack, and Linear use bounded live probes with durable,
   secret-free evidence. A stored credential remains visibly unverified until a probe succeeds;
   Doctor does not report it healthy.
2. **TRAP: Google's third-party-access list shows the CONSENT-SCREEN app name, not the OAuth
   client name.** A tester revoking "the app they created today" can revoke a different grant
   (we hit this: a June-era grant under the same name). The curl revoke endpoint is deterministic;
   prefer it for the break step.
3. **Resolved in the maintainer CLI:** `register-app` and `set-key` now show clear terminal
   prompts and hide secrets. Non-interactive stdin remains available for automation.
4. Callback window is 5 minutes; a missed browser tab times out cleanly and is safely retryable.
5. **Passed on PR #221:** the complete Google loop twice and Linear loop once against the
   post-Phase-2/3 engine. This is the live-account evidence for the lifted judgment layer.
6. **Still held after Phase 5e:** `/connect` is implemented on draft PR #231, but it is not shipped
   or claimable. The independent rereview found that another same-user process can still invoke
   the shipped decryptor, read the persistent broker capability, and obtain usable credentials
   through the unprompted default accessor.
7. **Core hardening after that rereview:** caller-controlled presence command/optional/TTL
   environment switches are ignored, grants are scoped to one connection plus one operation, and
   a symlinked or foreign-owned token subdirectory fails before a credential write. These close
   bounded findings; they do not resolve the decryptor/default-access contract.

## Go/no-go

- **GO:** ship and describe the engine as local-first, encrypted at rest, relay-free, redirect
  rejecting, pinned for reviewed providers, contract-frozen, Doctor-visible, and live-account
  exercised for Google and Linear.
- **NO-GO:** ship or advertise `/connect`, Touch ID protection, broker-only decryption, or defense
  from other software already running as the user.
- **Manual gate after redesign:** run this full Google-twice + Linear-once battery again through
  the real signed presence host. No automated fixture substitutes for that result.
